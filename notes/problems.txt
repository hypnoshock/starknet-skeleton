Problem:

If trying to set a 250x250 array of numbers using recursion I get
Error: End of program was not reached
I'm able to do 100 * 100

Either this is because it takes too long or because the stack is too deep.

Possible solution:
- Fill the array using multiple transactions

Problem:

I'm having real trouble filling an array of values to be returned by a functions. My goal is to fill and array with perlin noise and because it's generative, not have to store it anywhere. I just cannot seem to fill an array created using alloc(). The best I can do is fill a storage variable map


Problem:
Why no loops? If they were of const length the compiler could unroll them. Absolute joke!
